                        <p>The owners of Nutty Squirrel are relatives of the <a href="fg.html" target="_blank" class="link">Fainting Goat</a> family. The owners felt their current website was heavily focused on kids and family, and sought to have a more “mature” feel without being too serious. This project was a challenging ebb and flow of ideas and obstacles that gave me an opportunity to explain the reasoning behind certain design decisions.</p>

                        <p>First meeting points from owner:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>family business</li>
                            <li>change flavors daily/update to Facebook automatically</li>
                            <li>art/artist wall</li>
                            <li>tree in shop</li>
                            <li>wholesale/catering</li>
                            <li>“Strawberry” the tricycle</li>
                            <li>focal point on social sites</li>
                            <li>red &amp; white scalloped awning</li>
                            <li>changeable logo</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>While I didn’t agree with all of these points right away, I wanted to sleep on it and have valid reasons prepared for our next meeting. Changing the flavors daily didn’t seem necessary, especially since their main flow of traffic is through their Facebook page.
                        Highlighting a 3D printed wooden tree that they have in the shop - in web format, doesn’t tell you anything about the shop or what they offer. Adds to the ambiance once you’re physically in the store.</p> 
                        
                        <p>art/artist wall is not a prominent piece of their business, and again takes focus away from their product.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-xs">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/art-wall.jpg"></a>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>red &amp; white scalloped awning, typically seen in physical form, does not translate well into web form. Comes off as awkward, loud, intangible, etc.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-xs">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/ns-banner.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>changeable logo - this caused significant friction. They wanted to add a mustache to their logo for Father’s Day, make it orange for Halloween, put a Santa hat on it for Christmas, etc. My reasonings were that they did not want to mess with their branding, especially because they are a small business. You don’t want people visiting the site and thinking the “holiday” logo at the moment is their actual logo. Causes a lot of confusion and unnecessary work. Bigger, more established companies like Google, Apple, etc. can do this because they are a household brand. People will not be visiting the gelato site to see what kind of logo they have.</p> 

                        <p>Consistent through the sites I’ve built, I want users to feel like they are in control. An easy way to do this is by permitting easy reversal of actions and helping users recover from errors.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>persistent navigation to home page through site ID</li>
                            <li>smooth scrolling back to navigation sections, even in a single page layout such as this one</li>
                            <li>exact navigation on 404 page as main page, leading back to relevant spots on main page</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>I knew from my recent experience with Fainting Goat that I wanted to take the product photography myself, so I started there to give myself content to work with.</p> 

                        <div class="grid">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/cake.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/gelato.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/gelato-pans.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/pint.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/trike.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/affogato.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>I was actually pretty proud of the first Home page I created (minus a few polishing points), but the owners weren’t happy with having such a strong emphasis on the logo if they weren’t able to change it often. They also felt the image wasn’t appetizing enough. I still think this is a lovely home page, but I was certain I could create something we all agreed on.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-mid grid">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/ns-home-sketch.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/home-v1.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>I recycled some of the writing on their previous site and removed a good amount of “happy talk” to use in the About section. The first pass felt like a website for an advertising company, with about sections for each owner and separated by a quote banner. The banner background image didn’t tell the user anything about the business, and the separation of the owners didn’t feel particularly warm. (Disclaimer: photo of Tolga is a placeholder.)</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/about-v1.jpg"></a>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>After a meeting with the owners and receiving crucial feedback from them, we decided to include a family image of them and their son, and talk only about the business instead of each owner. Users don’t have time to read a lengthy bio, and would want to read about the business, not each owners background. (Disclaimer: the family portrait is the only photo that I did not take. The portrait was also replaced with one that was less stylized and high contrast to blend better with the rest of the site design.)</p>

                        <div class="wrap-xs">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/about.jpg"></a>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>The owners loved the layout of the Fainting Goat website, and wanted theirs to be similar. At first, I was hesitant because I wanted my portfolio to show a wide range of designs. Ultimately, I decided to do what was best for the project and not for me.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/ns-layout.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>Because the site’s success doesn’t depend on visitors coming back, frequently updating the site didn’t seem necessary. To signal that the site (and business) is alive and well, providing subtle social buttons in the top right hand corner allows visitors to link out to a more active medium for the business. It was a delicate balance between making them prominent enough without de-emphasizing the main navigation.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/social-detail.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>
