                        <h2>Nutty Squirrel Gelato</h2>

                        <p>The owners of Nutty Squirrel are relatives of the <a href="fg.html" target="_blank">Fainting Goat</a>, and reached out to me to for a redesign once they saw their parents site. They felt their current website was heavily focused on kids and family, and sought to have a more “mature” feel without being too serious.</p>

                        <h3>Design + Development</h3>

                        <p>I met with the owners over coffee to discuss their wants and needs for the site:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>focus on family business</li>
                            <li>change flavors daily/update to Facebook automatically</li>
                            <li>showcase artist wall</li>
                            <li>highlighting a laser cut wooden tree graphic they have in the shop</li>
                            <li>wholesale/catering</li>
                            <li>“Strawberry” the tricycle</li>
                            <li>focal point on social sites</li>
                            <li>scalloped awning graphic</li>
                            <li>changeable logo</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>While I didn’t agree that all of these requests were necessary, I wanted to be able to back up my reasons why. I went home and took some notes, considering both sides to each point.</p> 
                        
                        <p>I knew from my recent experience with Fainting Goat and Yoroshiku that I wanted to take the product photography myself. I started there to give myself more content to work with.</p>

                        <div class="grid-2">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/cake.jpg">

                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/trike.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">After the photoshoot, I met with the owners again before moving forward. We went over the points brought up in our first meeting, and I explained why I disagreed with some of them:</p> 

                        <ol>
                            <li>changeable logo – they wanted to add a mustache to their logo for Father’s Day, make it orange for Halloween, put a Santa hat on it for Christmas, etc. I explained that I thought this was a bad idea because:</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>they did not want to mess with their branding, especially as a small business</li>
                                    <li>they don’t want people visiting the site and thinking the “holiday” logo at the moment is their actual logo</li>
                                    <li>bigger, more established companies like Google, Apple, etc. can do this because they are a household brand</li>
                                    <li>their chance of repeat visitors is low</li>
                                </ol>
                            <li>wooden tree graphic – worked well in the shop, but in web format it doesn’t tell you anything about them or what they offer</li>

                            <div class="wrap-sm">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/ns/tree.jpg">
                                </figure>
                            </div>

                            <li>artist wall – this was not a prominent piece of their business, and takes the focus away from their product</li>

                            <div class="wrap-xs">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/ns/art-wall.jpg"></a>
                                </figure>
                            </div>

                            <li>scalloped awning graphic – typically seen in physical form, does not translate well into web form. Comes off as awkward, loud, intangible, etc.</li>

                            <div class="wrap-xs">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/ns/ns-banner.jpg">
                                </figure>
                            </div>

                            <li>changing flavors daily – this was still a possible option, but automatically uploading to Facebook was not</li>
                        </ol>


                        <p>After taking notes of their feedback and making sure we were all on the same page, I got started on a layout.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-xs">
                            <figure>
                                <img class="white" src="img/ns/ns-sketch.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">I was actually pretty proud of the first Home page I created (minus a few polishing points), but the owners weren’t happy with having such a strong emphasis on the logo if they weren’t able to change it. They also felt the image wasn’t appetizing enough. I still thought this was a lovely home page, but I was certain I could create something we all agreed on.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/home-v1.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <p class="first">The first pass of the About section felt like a website for an advertising company, with bios for each owner and separated by a quote banner. The writing was recycled from their previous site, and it just felt too heavy. The background image of the flowers didn’t tell the visitor anything about the business, and the separation of the owner bios didn’t feel particularly warm or welcoming. (Note: the male image was a silly placeholder.)</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/about-v1.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">After a meeting with the owners and receiving crucial feedback from them, we decided to include a family image of them and their son, and talk about the business as a whole instead of each owner.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/family-1.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">The image they provided was much more inviting, but the high contrast and style of the photo didn’t match the aesthetic of the ones I shot for the site. The family photo was the only one I didn’t shoot, so we agreed on one that we were all happy with.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/family-2.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">I wasn’t happy with the first version of the layout. I was honest with myself that I was eager to jump right into designing mocks, and that it showed in the work–I had let my anticipation get the best of me.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-xxs">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/anticipation.gif">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">I reevaluated my game plan. The owners loved the layout of the Fainting Goat website, and wanted theirs to be similar. At first I was hesitant because I wanted my portfolio to show a wide range of designs, but I ultimately decided to do what was best for the project. I went back to my sketchbook to jot down the layout.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img class="white" src="img/ns/ns-layout.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">The homepage highlighted their recent accomplishment of being voted “Best Ice Cream Shop in Western Washington”, giving the visitor a reason for being on this site and not somewhere else. The intro, along with the background image, also gives visitors a pretty good idea what the company offers.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/home.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <p class="first">I used a few lines of Javascript that created a “sticky” navigation bar as soon as scrolling begins. The nav bar turns from transparent to solid white, while shrinking with the logo to make room for the content.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/sticky-nav.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <p class="first">Because the site’s success doesn’t depend on visitors coming back, frequently updating the site didn’t seem necessary. To signal that the site (and business) is alive and well, providing subtle social buttons in the top right hand corner allows visitors to link out to a more active medium for the business. It was a delicate balance between making them prominent enough without de-emphasizing the main navigation.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/ns/social-detail.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">The About section was short and sweet, giving visitors just the right amount of information about their business.</p>

                        <p>I explained that the writing needed to be heavily trimmed down for a couple reasons:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>visitors generally don’t have time to read lengthy bios; they are looking for information about the business</li>
                            <li>it gets in the way of the important information, possibly causing frustration for visitors who have to scroll through a large About section</li>
                        </ol>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/about.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <p class="first">The Menu section was short and sweet, focusing on the quality of their product. Changing the flavors daily didn’t seem necessary after all since their main flow of traffic is through their Facebook page, which I linked to in the section.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/menu-1.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/menu-2.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <p class="first">The Catering section featured their tricycle that they showcase at farmer’s markets and parties. The front compartment is a freezer where they store single-serve gelato cups, and something they were (rightfully) proud of.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/catering-1.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/catering-2.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <p class="first">The Contact page originally worked around an image so that the contact info was off to the right. This fell out of alignment with the repeatable structure already in place, as well as the high contrast not working. I decided to center the contact information and used a lighter image so the contrast wasn’t so intense.</p> 

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/contact-v1.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/ns/contact-v2.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <h3>Deployment</h3>

                        <p>As this was my third time deploying a site, I felt like a seasoned pro by now.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img class="white" src="img/ns/pro.gif">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="first">Before going to bed, I logged into their existing GoDaddy account, redirected their DNS records, and made sure the files were in their right place. I waited for the site to surface, but for some reason things were taking longer than usual.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>

                        <p>During this process I learned:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>push back isn't always a bad thing. On the contrary, questioning the design usually makes it stronger.</li>
                            <li>anticipation, laziness, focus–it all shines through in your work</li>
                            <li>always approach complex tasks like it was your first time</li>
                            <li>do what's best for the client, not your design portfolio</li>
                        </ol>
