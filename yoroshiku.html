                        <p>I was approached by restaurant owner and friend, Kay Keisuke, about redesigning his previous website. Already a neighborhood favorite, I was thrilled to be a part of the big changes happening at Yoroshiku. This was a fun yet challenging project that allowed me to take my knowledge of web design a step further.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/kay-koichi.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>The main things Kay wanted to include on the new website were:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>new photography</li>
                            <li>a more personal and intimate About section</li>
                            <li>an updateable menu</li>
                            <li>lunch, dinner, drink, and happy hour menus (was in the process of getting liquor license when site was being built)</li>
                            <li>contact page</li>
                            <li>new logo</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>His previous web presence was an outdated Wordpress site that was broken in some parts. The photos were of recipes that weren’t on the menu anymore.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/4649.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>A little too excited, I jumped straight to building mocks in Sketch. I wanted to play with the idea of a fixed side navigation, but it just didn't feel right.</p>

                        <div class="grid">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/yoroshiku-layout.jpg"/>
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/yoroshiku-menu-v1.jpg"/>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>I realized I needed more content to work with, so I sat with Kay over tea to get a more detailed account of how his path led him to Yoroshiku. My goal was to dive deeper than the average bio, making the reader feel as warm as I do when I walk in the restaurant. I wanted to showcase the incredible efforts Kay has made to turn his dream into a reality, but also giving the bio room to breathe.</p>

                        </figure> 

                        <p>I also offered to do the photography, which was a fun (and filling) process:</p>

                        <div class="grid">
                            <figure>

                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/chicken.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/light.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/yoroshiku/jump.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>To keep the visual design consistent once I was out of the picture, and without having to rely on new photography when the menu changed, I thought it would make sense to only photograph items that were permanently on the menu.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>For the main nav, I made selected states bold as well as green for accessibility.</p>

                        <p>I gave the lower level navigation the same attention as the main, giving list items a darker selected state.</p>

                        <p>The Contact page only included the necessary information, while giving visitors options to make a reservation, place a To-Go order, call, email, or find the restaurant, and see their business hours. I kept the page open and clean, as well as using simpe <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> icons, allowing visitors to find the information they need without distractions.</p>

                        Consistent through the sites I’ve built, I want users to feel like they are in control. An easy way to do this is by permitting easy reversal of actions and helping users recover from errors. 
                        persistent navigation to home page through site ID
                        smooth scrolling back to navigation sections, even in a single page layout such as this one
                        exact navigation on 404 page, leading back to relevant spots on main site</p>

                        <p>The new logo was a challenge I accepted with equal parts excitement and dread – I had never made a logo before and had no idea what I was doing. Thanks to countless tutorials, stellar guidance, and lots of coffee, I designed a logo that we were both proud of.</p>

                        <p>I originally started on pen and paper, sketching out the first that came to mind. The traditional Japanese seigaiha wave has always been a favorite of mine, so I kept being drawn back to it during the process. I also had Kay draw the symbol for Yoroshiku, meaning "pleased to meet you", in different pen and marker weights.</p>

                        <p>The green on green concept reminded me way too much of the Starbucks logo, so I trashed it and went with my original plan of black and green. The original combination was way too harsh on the eyes, but by darkening the green and lightening the black opacity, it became much more pleasant.</p>
