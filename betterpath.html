            <h2>BetterPath Case Study Exercise</h2>

            <h1>Exercise</h1>
            <p>We’re building a simple service/app that is a value add to an existing calendaring app/system. It’s called HeadsUp. It needs to deliver a well-timed summary to you of what your day’s going to look like in terms of important meetings, so you can be well prepared. A happy HeadsUp user is never slipping on ice or breaking into a sweat as they run to the subway because they’ve forgotten the 9am meeting with an important potential investor that went on the calendar 3 weeks ago.</p>

            <p>The initial product idea is for this to be some sort of smartphone app that will work with your existing calendar system (eg. Google Calendar). What sets it apart from standard calendar notifications is the smarts it has. The product learns about what things to notify you of and when to time them. It produces well-timed summaries of what’s on your horizon just when you need them.</p>

            <p class="last">Ask any questions to clarify any large functional pieces or target audience questions. Then sketch out your interaction ideas. Also begin to develop the visual look-and-feel of the app—provide an early visual direction (this can be supplemented with notes and inspiration from elsewhere). We’re not expecting a fully fleshed out design, just enough to both elicit feedback and confirm direction for the visual concept.</p> 

            <h3>Sketches</h3>

            <p>Some things I wanted to take into consideration for the app were:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>location (GPS)</li>
                <li>privacy (email, contacts, calendar, etc.)</li>
                <li>delays (traffic, events, train out of service, etc.)</li>
                <li>subway schedule</li>
                <li>Uber</li>
              </ol>

            <p>I started sketching out <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows" target="_blank">shorthand</a> UI flows for a high-level view of the problem.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/betterpath/01-ui-flow.JPG">
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/betterpath/03-ui-flow.JPG">

              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">Next, I sketched out individual screens and created flows from them.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/betterpath/01-sketch.JPG">
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/betterpath/02-sketch.JPG">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">I had some ideas for schedule conflicts using a native calendar app. What if a woman scheduled a meeting at a café across town and she wouldn't have enough time to get to her next meeting? I wanted HeadsUp to know how long it would take to get to the second meeting, and update in real-time based on traffic, events, etc., but I would also want the user to be aware of immediate delays at the time of scheduling.</p> 

            <p>Since HeadsUp would be sending requests to the calendar app, and not the other way around, HeadsUp would have no way of knowing there was a conflict in the schedule until it was too late. Users would get a notification from HeadsUp after the meeting has been scheduled in their calendar app, informing them of a conflict, but that's like booking an airline ticket and getting a call from an agent telling you the flight is booked. My first reaction would be "Why was I allowed to book it then?" Ideally, HeadsUp would be able to prevent any meetings from being scheduled if there was a conflict.</p> 

            <p>With more time, this would be a fun problem to tackle.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/betterpath/02-ui-flow.JPG">
              </figure>
            </div>


            <h3>Wireframes</h3>

            <p>I created wireframes for each screen from my sketches, followed by flows.</p>

            <h1>Notification flow</h1>

            <p>Notifications are the main feature of HeadsUp, giving users timely alerts of any changes in their schedule, as well as reminders. For changes, this would range from a a parade on Main St. causing a delay to your 3:00pm meeting, to a train being out of service, to plain old city traffic. One idea would be to give HeadsUp access to a company's org chart, notifying the user when someone "important" is added to the meeting. <span class="italic">"John Smith, CTO, will be joining your 9:30am meeting tomorrow. Dress nice and show up early!"</span></p>

            <p>For reminders, each meeting would have a detailed screens of attendees, meeting location, discussion topic, and directions. I wanted HeadsUp to have access to attendees' calendars, that way if someone needed to reschedule a meeting, HeadsUp would provide various dates and times that worked for everyone. A user would choose a time(s), and an email would be populated with the selections (unless everything was through the app, which would be even better).</p>

            <figure>
              <a href="img/betterpath/notification-flow-2x.png" target="_blank"><img class="white cursor hover" src="img/betterpath/notification-flow.png"></a>
            </figure>

            <h1>Default flow</h1>

            <p>While notifications are the main feature of HeadsUp, there will be times when users ignore them. When this happens, notifications would be stored in HeadsUp until they are checked. When a user opens HeadsUp, they would be presented with their missed notifications and their detailed schedule for the day.</p>

            <p>The default flow would be the same as the notification flow, just with a different starting point.</p>

            <figure>
              <a href="img/betterpath/headsup-default-flow-2x.png" target="_blank"><img class="white cursor hover" src="img/betterpath/headsup-default-flow.png"></a>
            </figure>

            <h1>Alarm flow</h1>

            <p>I really liked the idea of giving HeadsUp access to the existing alarm app, and using it to wake the user up earlier. For example, say I have a meeting scheduled 30 minutes away from my house at 9:30am and I set my alarm for 8:30am, giving myself 30 minutes to get ready. What if my usual train is suddenly out of service and I still wake up at 8:30am? If the alternate routes takes an hour, I will have to rush through my morning and arrive at my meeting flustered, out of breath, and disarranged. HeadsUp would override my alarm and go off at 8:00am, giving me the same amount of time I originally accounted for to get to my meeting.</p> 

            <p>This feature would have to be authorized in the "Preferences" section of the app, because not all users would want this.</p>
            
            <figure>
              <a href="img/betterpath/alarm-flow-2x.png" target="_blank"><img class="white cursor hover" src="img/betterpath/alarm-flow.png"></a>
            </figure>

            <h1>Combined flows</h1>

            <figure>
              <a href="img/betterpath/flows-2x.png" target="_blank"><img class="white cursor hover" src="img/betterpath/flows.png"></a>
            </figure>

            <h3>Visual Direction</h3>

            <p>I created a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jodiprkr/headsup/" target="_blank">pinboard</a> with flat UI designs and fun color schemes for inspiration. I wanted the visual design to be clean, simple, and focused – removing any irrelevant material from the copy as well as the UI. With more time, I would dial in the colors, fonts, and spacing.</p>
