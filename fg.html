                        <h1> Fainting Goat Gelato</h1>

                        <p>Fainting Goat Gelato was the first website I had the pleasure of launching. I noticed they only had a Blogspot as a website, and approached the owners about building a site for no charge. After convincing them that I had no ulterior motives, I was given full creative control with plenty of time to spread my wings.</p>

                        <p>I began by sitting with the owners and talking about the main points to include on the site (About Us, Menu, Press, Contact Info). They are part of a large, tight-knit Turkish family, and wanted to include that on the site. For the menu section, we decided to include the flavors they offer throughout the year, noting ones that are seasonal, and that any off-hand special flavors can be announced through their Facebook and Instagram accounts.</p> 
                
                        <p>My first pass included a much-too-large logo, some low-quality images of the shop that I found through Yelp, and Futura as the only font throughout the site. I even added an extra Instagram button at the bottom, you know, in case people didn’t see the first one. I thought to myself “This is it. This website is great!”</p>

                        <p>After building my mocks in markup, I noticed my machine was running slow. I decided to run a clean install on my machine and experienced my first heartbreak as a web designer...I accidentally deleted all my code.<i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i></p> 

                        <p>With a few tears and clenched fists under my belt, I started over.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/fg/fg-home-v1.jpg">
                        </figure>
                        

                        <p>Of course, this was all for the best. I quickly started noticing all the mistakes I had made in my previous design, and began seeing my lost code as a blessing in disguise. Wanting to keep the design consistent, I felt it best to just take the product photos myself. I played with some more layout ideas, but nothing was good enough. Feeling stuck in Mockland, I moved back to pen and paper.</p>
