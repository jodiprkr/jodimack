                        <p>Fainting Goat Gelato was the first website I designed and built. Already a loyal customer, I noticed the only substantial web presence they had was an outdated Blogger site. I approached the owners about building a new site from scratch, free of charge, so that I could gain some experience with relatively low stakes (and low expectations). After convincing them I had no ulterior motives, I was given full creative control with plenty of time to spread my wings.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/fg/fg-sketch.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>I began by sitting with the owners and talking about the main points to include on the site: About, Menu, Press, Contact. Realizing it would be time-consuming for all of us to update the Press section anytime there was something new, we decided to scratch it.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/fg/fg-home-v1.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>My first pass was (in hindsight) pretty bland, but my rookie spirit thought to herself “This is it. This website is great!” After building my mocks in markup, I noticed my machine was running slow. I decided to run a clean install on my machine and experienced my first heartbreak as a web designer...I accidentally deleted all my code.</p>

                        <div class="wrap-xs">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/fg/dawsons-cry.jpg"></a>
                            </figure>
                        </div><!-- /.wrap-sm -->

                        <span>With a few tears and clenched fists under my belt, I started over.</span>

                        <p>Of course, this was a blessing in disguise, as I quickly started noticing all the design flaws I had made in the previous design: a much-too-large logo, some low-quality images of the shop that I found through Yelp, and Futura as the only font throughout the site. There was even (accidentally) an extra Instagram button at the bottom – you know, in case people didn’t see the first one. I also got real friendly with Github after this experience.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <a href="https://github.com/jodiprkr" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/github.jpg"/></a>
                        </figure>

                        <p>I took a step back to look at the bigger picture, made some crucial notes, and forged ahead. Wanting to keep the design consistent, I felt it best to take the product photos myself. Taking photographs is a hobby I’ve kept aflame since high school, and I was thrilled for the opportunity to merge two passions together.</p>

                        <div class="grid">
                            <figure>

                            </figure>

                            <figure>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>I played with different layout ideas, but nothing seemed to fit.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/fg/fg-layout-v1.jpg">
                            </figure>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/fg/fg-draft.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>I wanted playful, but not too loud, minimal, but not too bare, enticing, not banal. Feeling stuck in my Sketch mocks, I moved back to pen and paper.</p> 

                        <p>My first pass included parallaxing text and images, plus a fading slider of images on the home page. While I was able to (miraculously) figure out how to make the sections parallax, I didn’t really know how it worked. It was basically glued together and hanging on by a thread, and I didn’t feel confident I would be able to fix it if something went wrong. As impressive as it looked, I decided to scrap it. My final sketches tied everything together, giving me a repeatable structure to work with.</p>
                        
                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/fg/fg-layout-v2.jpg">
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>The Home page intro delivers the site identity and mission, answering important UX questions for the visitor:

                        <ol>
                            <li>What is this?</li>
                            <li>What does this website offer?</li>
                            <li>What can I do here?</li>
                            <li>Why should I be here and not somewhere else?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <figure>
                            <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-home.jpg"/></a>
                        </figure>

                        <p>persistent navigation to home page through site ID</p>

                        <p>The About section was heavily trimmed down from their previous site, omitting needless words and providing several benefits:</p>

                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>reduced the noise level of the page</li> 
                            <li>made useful content more prominent</li>
                            <li>made the section shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling</li>
                            <li>removed small talk, which most users don’t have time for</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The shop owners are part of a large, tight-knit Turkish family and pour an incredible amount of their love into their product. I wanted readers to see the loving side of them that I saw, so I added a fun hovering state to their profile photo, showing their dynamic nature.</p> 

                        <div class="wrap-sm">
                            <figure>
                                <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#about" target="_blank"><img src='img/fg/sevim-yalcin-1.jpg' width='600' height='430' onmouseover="this.src='img/fg/sevim-yalcin-2.jpg';" onmouseout="this.src='img/fg/sevim-yalcin-1.jpg';"/></a>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p>For the menu, I decided to include the flavors offered throughout the year (noting ones that are seasonal) and that any off-hand special flavors can be announced through their Facebook and Instagram accounts. In the end, it seemed redundant to list flavors that are seasonal when it is mentioned that the flavors are rotated daily. This was an important piece of information for two reasons: (1) it avoids any customer expectations of what’s available that day, and (2) the website menu didn’t need to be changed daily.</p> 

                        <figure>
                            <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#menu" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-menu-1.jpg"/></a>
                        </figure>

                        </figure>

                        <p>The Contact page includes all the information needed, without making the reader scour the page to find what they’re looking for. The background image of Wallingford’s neighborhood mural was a favorite of the shop owners, while the watercolor map from <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/#12/37.7706/-122.3782" target="_blank">Stamen</a> was mine.</p>


                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        
                         
                        <p>After meticulously building the site, committing changes to GitHub, uploading everything onto S3, and finally launching it, a sudden wave of adrenaline came over me. I felt enormous pride for this thing I just created; visiting and revisiting the site, thinking to myself “I made that!”</p> 

                        <p>The owners were so happy with the results, as well as my persistent hard work, that they ended up cutting me a check for $500. (not sure how to end this.)</p>
