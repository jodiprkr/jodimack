            <h2>Fainting Goat Gelato</h2>

            <p>Fainting Goat Gelato was the first website I designed and built. Already a loyal customer, I noticed the only web presence they had was an outdated Blogger site. I approached the owners about building a new site from scratch, free of charge, so that I could gain experience with relatively low stakes (and low expectations). After convincing them I had no ulterior motives, I was given full creative control.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <h1>Designed, built, and deployed using:</h1>

              <ol class="grid-2">

            <h3 class="second">Design and Development</h3>

            <p>I began by meeting with the owners to discuss their needs and the needs of their customers. We decided that the site should be simple, easy to use, and include the following top-level navigation: Home, About, Menu, Press, Contact. At the last minute, I added a Blog section which simply linked to their existing Blogger site.</p> 

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/fg-sketch.jpg">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">After meeting with the owners, I jumped straight into designing mocks. I gathered as much content as I could find; screenshots, images from Yelp and Google, existing copy from their blog, and press articles. I made sure the navigation showed selected states, the color palette was complementary and fun, and the company name was prominent and legible.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/home-v1.jpg">
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/about-v1.jpg">
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/menu-v1.jpg">
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/press-v1.jpg">
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/contact-v1.jpg">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">Once I felt confident in the design, I started building the mocks using HTML and CSS. I scrutinized every line of code, double-checked every link, and ensured that the markup and style sheets were pixel perfect representations of my designs. I was just about ready to launch this bad boy....</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/dropmic.gif">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">...and then I accidentally deleted all my code.</p>

            <div class="wrap-xs">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/dawsons-cry.jpg">
              </figure>
            </div><!-- /.wrap-sm -->

            <p class="first">Once I got over the initial heartbreak, I realized it was all for the best, as I quickly started noticing flaws in the previous design:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>logo was too big</li>
              <li>low image quality</li>
              <li>poor typeface selection</li>
              <li>too much writing in the About section. I ditched the “Our Family” portion and combined parts of it with “About Us”.</li>
              <li>the Press section seemed redundant after I realized there wasn’t much fresh coverage, and I didn’t want to link to stale content.</li>
              <li>I felt like I was missing an opportunity to make the site great, not just good</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I also removed the Blog section for a few reasons:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>it was outdated and they rarely used it</li> 
              <li>again, I didn’t want to link to stale content</li>
              <li>their Facebook was relatively active and is a sufficient platform to communicate with customers</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="last">When I learned there was a way to backup my code so that it was accessible on any machine, at any time, I took a few days off to deep dive on Git, GitHub, and Terminal.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/terminal.jpg"/>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <figure>
              <a href="https://github.com/jodiprkr" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/github.jpg"/></a>
            </figure>

            <p class="first">The ability to share what I was working on with my peers was an added bonus. After consuming endless tutorials, receiving guidance from experienced friends, and dozens of commits later, I knew there was no turning back.</p> 

            <div class="wrap-xxs">
              <figure>
                <img class="white" src="img/fg/pacman-github.jpg"/>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p>I set up a time to shoot some higher quality photos than the ones I gathered previously. Photography has been a passion of mine since I started high school, so I was psyched on the idea of incorporating it into my design work.</p>

            <div class="grid-2">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/ari-1.jpg" alt=""/>
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/owners.jpg" alt=""/>
              </figure>

              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">Once I had all the content, I took another stab at the mocks. I played around with different ideas but nothing seemed to be working.</p> 

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/fg-draft-4.jpg"/>
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/fg-draft-2.jpg"/>
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/fg-draft-3.jpg"/>
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/fg-draft-1.jpg"/>
              </figure>
            </div>
            
            <p class="first">I wanted playful, but not too loud, minimal, but not too sparse, original, not banal. Feeling stuck in my mocks, I moved back to pen and paper.</p> 

            <p>I sketched out some ideas that included parallaxing sections throughout the site, plus a fading image slider on the home page.</p>
            
            <div class="wrap-xs">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/fg-layout-v1.jpg">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first last">I scoured the best, up-to-date, parallaxing sites I could find, and tried my hand at reverse-engineering them. While I was able to make everything parallax, I didn’t really know how the site worked. Basically, it was glued together with duct tape and chewing gum, and I didn’t feel confident I would be able to fix it if something went wrong.</p>

            <div class="wrap-xs">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/dunno.gif">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">As impressive as it looked, I decided to scrap it.</p>

            <p class="last">My final sketches tied everything together once I decided on a single page layout. Using strong images as full-width backgrounds allowed me to say less, letting the images do most of the talking.</p> 

            <div class="wrap-xs">
              <figure>
                <img class="white" src="img/fg/fg-layout-v2.jpg">
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">I wanted to come right out of the gates with something airy, enticing, and fun, so I changed their traditional logo from red to pink, and created a color palette to match (fun fact: the owners loved the pink logo so much, they want to permanently change it.)</p>

            <p>The Home page intro delivers the site identity and mission, which answers important questions for the visitor:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>What is this?</li>
              <li>What does this website offer?</li>
              <li>What can I do here?</li>
              <li>Why should I be here and not somewhere else?</li>
            </ol>

            <figure>
              <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-home.jpg"/></a>
            </figure>

            <p class="first last">I wanted users to have persistent navigation to the home page by clicking the logo, whether it was from the main site or 404 page.</p>

            <figure>
              <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/sdkvjghsd" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-404.jpg"/></a>
            </figure>

            <p class="first last">As I mentioned earlier, the About section was heavily trimmed down, omitting needless words while providing several benefits</p>

            <ol>
              <li>reduced the noise level of the page</li> 
              <li>made useful content more prominent</li>
              <li>made the section shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling</li>
              <li>removed small talk, which most users don’t have time for</li>
            </ol>

            <figure>
              <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#about" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-about.jpg"/></a>
            </figure>

            <p class="first last">The shop owners are part of a large, tight-knit Turkish family and pour an incredible amount of love into their product. I wanted readers to see the bonded, playful side of them that I saw, so I added a fun hovering state to their profile photo.</p> 

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#about" target="_blank"><img src='img/fg/sevim-yalcin-1.jpg' width='600' height='430' onmouseover="this.src='img/fg/sevim-yalcin-2.jpg';" onmouseout="this.src='img/fg/sevim-yalcin-1.jpg';"/></a>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">For the menu, I originally decided to include the flavors offered throughout the year (noting ones that are seasonal) and that any off-hand special flavors can be announced through their Facebook. In the end, it seemed redundant to list flavors that are seasonal when it already  mentions the flavors are rotated daily. This was an important piece of information for two reasons:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>it avoids any customer expectations of what’s available that day</li>
              <li>the website menu didn’t need to be changed daily</li>
            </ol> 

            <figure>
              <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#menu" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-menu-1.jpg"/></a>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#menu-text" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-menu-2.jpg"></a>
            </figure>

            <p class="first">The Contact section included only the necessary information:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>where they’re located</li>
              <li>how to contact them</li>
              <li>when they're open</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I featured the local neighborhood mural as the background, and a <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/#12/37.7706/-122.3782" target="_blank">custom watercolor map</a> that linked to their location on Google Maps.</p>

            <figure>
              <a href="http://faintinggoatseattle.com/#contact" target="_blank"><img src="img/fg/fg-contact.jpg"></a>
            </figure>
            
            <p class="last">Finally, I made sure to include accessibility features such as “Skip to Content” and alt tags on images, or at least empty quotations so the image could be skipped over if not pertinent.</p>

            <h3>Deployment</h3>

            <p class="thought">“Great, the site is finished! Now how do I get it on the internets?!”</p>

            <p>With the help of my peers, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html" target="_blank">guided tutorials</a>, and hours of practice, I learned about setting up a static web page using a custom domain through <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>

            <p>Once the owners and I settled on a name, I registered the domain through <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>.</p>

            <p>Next, I used Amazon S3 to create buckets, which are basically just storage units for data. I created two buckets (www.faintinggoatseattle.com and faintinggoatseattle.com) so that requests for both led to the same place.</p>

            <p>Next, I configured Route 53 as my DNS provider, and transferred all of the DNS records from Namecheap. Granted, I could have used the registrar (Namecheap) as my DNS provider, but keeping all my data in one place gave me peace of mind.</p>

            <p>I uploaded the final files and waited for them to propagate…</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/waiting.gif"/>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>Once the site was live, a sudden wave of boss-inducing adrenaline came over me.</p>

            <div class="wrap-sm">
              <figure>
                <img src="img/fg/bawss.gif"/>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="first">I felt enormous pride for this thing I just created; visiting and revisiting the site thinking “Damn, I made that!” The owners were so happy with the results, as well as my persistence, that they ended up writing me a check for $500.</p>

            <p>In the end, I learned:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>design is a process</li>
                <li>early iterations will suck</li>
                <li>how to use S3, Route 53, and GitHub</li>
                <li>ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR CODE</li>
                <li>never pass up the opportunity to trade for gelato</li>
              </ol>
