      <p><a class="link" href="https://www.answerdash.com/" target="_blank">AnswerDash</a> is a Seattle-based startup that uses machine learning to provide contextually relevant customer support. Businesses integrate AnswerDash's technology into their websites and mobile apps so they can reduce response times to frequently asked questions and increase sales.</p>

      <p>I joined AnswerDash in April 2016 as their lead product designer. They were looking for someone who could own product as well as drive design efforts across the company. From user research, interface design, and prototyping, to brand identity and marketing materials, my role spanned all aspects of the product development process.</p>

    <div class="wrap-sm">
      <p>AnswerDash was founded in 2012 by two HCI professors at the University of Washington. Being the scrappy startup that they were, they focused primarily on developing their core technolgoy, and placed less of an emphasis on brand identity. In the proceeding years the company received millions in venture capital, relocated from a small shared office on the UW campus to a highrise in downtown Seattle, hired a CTO with a staff of full-time engineers, a VP of Sales and Marketing with a dedicated sales team, a Customer Success Manager, and a professional CEO.</p>

      <p>While the shotgun branding might've been representative of the company in its early days, it didn't accurately reflect the company in its current form. In order to close key deals with established brands, many on the leadership team felt we needed a refresh on the existing identity.</p> 

      <p>Shortly before I joined, the company made this a top priority. In addition to a number of other concurrent projects, providing creative direction and collaborating with <a class="link" href="http://hecklerassociates.com/" target="_blank">Heckler Associates</a> (the agency we hired) occupied my first few months at AnswerDash.</p>

        <h2>End User Tool</h2>
      </article>

      <p>Most B2B products are rarely seen by end users. AnswerDash was unique in that we created products for other businesses (who we referred to internally as <i>Customers</i>), as well as <em>their</em> customers (who we referred to internally as <i>End Users</i>).</p>

      <p>Below is a screenshot of our End User Tool (the thing our customers integrated into their websites and mobile apps), as well as our Customer Tools Dashboard (the thing our customers used to monitor performance and manage content).</p>

        <h5 class="first">Visuals</h5>

        <p>A recurring feature request amongst existing customers, and a blocker for prospective ones, was the dated visual design of our End User Tool and its lack of customizability. We were missing sales opportunities with established brands who wanted fine grain control over iconography, layout, and spacing. Additionally, for customers who didn't have a team of in-house designers, we needed to ensure our default styling was both current and usable.</p> 

        <p>Because time and engineering resources were constrained, a radical overhaul of our current design was out of scope. By taking an iterative approach, I was able to work in parallel with the engineering team and implement small changes continuously. This allowed us to make steady progress, build momentum, and track the impact of our changes over time.</p>

        <h5 class="first">Interaction</h5>

        <p>Our existing expand/collapse model resulted in various bugs ranging from alignment issues, blocking content, and users losing context when expanding or collapsing a question.</p> 

        <p>I explored another option that included a hierarchical navigation system, giving each Q&amp;A their own dedicated screen. This style of navigation would support the structure and purpose of our product without calling attention to itself, making it natural for users to engage with.</p>

        <h5 class="first">Entry points</h5>
        <p>In the fall of 2016, we received repeated emails about a specific feature request: customers wanted the End User Tool to be draggable. Before proceeding, I took a step back and decoupled the problem from the proposed solution.</p>

        <p>The problem was that our tab covered content on their website.</p> 
      </div><!-- /.wrap-sm -->

        <div class="wrap-lg">
          <img class="case-lead" src="img/answerdash/eut-cover-content-1.png" />
        </div><!-- /.wrap-lg -->

        <div class="wrap-sm">
          <p class="first">One <em>possible</em> solution was to allow the tab to be moved around by dragging. The pro would be that users could move the tab out of the way, but I shared an important con with my team:</p>
       
        <blockquote>
          <p class="none">We would be forking our most important and primary interaction: opening AnswerDash. When clicking on the tab, not only could users launch our tab, they could also move it. This would add significant complexity to usage data, and result in error states, making it harder for us to optimize our product over time as we would never be certain of user intent. Adding that complexity doesn't seem worth the trade-off.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="first">Ideally, we should never allow the covering of content to be a state in the first place. Some alternate solutions I proposed were:</p>
         
        <blockquote>
          <p>a. Perform a design audit on our top N customers to see how they've successfully incorporated AnswerDash. Then create a set of implementation guidelines, calling out this potential state. This would allow us (mainly our Customer Success person) to fall back on these guidelines.</p>

          <p>b. My gut feeling tells me our new tab design (circular help button) will aid in curbing this state for our customers. We are also in the middle of incorporating a horizontal offset option (not just vertical, as we currently do) in Customer Tools, allowing customers to adjust the position of the button even further. 

          <p class="none">c. ??? Let’s explore some more together.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="first">The new circular help button and advanced placement controls addressed our customers' needs, allowing them to place the End User Tool exactly where they wanted.</p>

      <p>During the redesign of the end user tool, the company decided it was high time we had a competitive mobile presence. Our mobile web experience was rudimentary at best, so we took this opportunity to create consistency across all platforms (web, mobile web, and native mobile).</p>

      <p>We outsourced the SDK development to <a class="link" href="https://www.parkside.at/en/home" target="_blank">Parkside</a>, an Austrian software development studio. I worked alongside both teams to assure design consistency, deliver assets, clarify interactions and animations, and perform user testing as needed.

        <h2>Chatbot</h2>
      </article>

      <p>In April 2016, during Facebook’s F8 conference, Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of the Messenger Platform, as well as a new class of bots that would work inside Facebook Messenger's group chats. Shortly after, Facebook began to open up their APIs, allowing developers to create their own custom bots. By summer, the chatbot craze was in full effect <i class="em em-fire"></i> and AnswerDash thought we could leverage our technology to create a chatbot for our product line.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">The goal of the chatbot was to provide automated customer service, support, and sales, without the need for dedicated support staff.</span> AnswerDash's technology would sync with knowledge bases, cluster similar topics together, and surface them in the form of categories in the chatbot UI.</p> 

      <p>Given the limitations within the API, there was little to do in the way of custom visual design. However, I checked the Messenger Platform <a class="link" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a> daily to monitor new capabilities, and designed an experience that helped users find answers with minimal interaction.</p>

          <li>How can that data fit into a system?</li>

          <li>How can those pieces be customized by users?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I decided to go with a card-based interaction model to serve as entry points to more detailed information. This modular approach would support the addition or removal of cards in the future, allow users to customize the order of their data by dragging cards to a subjective sort order, and/or hide cards that weren't relevant to them. For example, there is a 'Live Chat' card, but not all customers support live chat.</p>
